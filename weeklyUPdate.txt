Moving forward, the focus will shift toward refining the responsiveness of all elements and ensuring that both desktop and mobile users have an optimized experience.
Additionally, upcoming tasks will include finalizing the development of the Login and Signup pages. This will ensure users can easily access and manage their accounts. Once these elements are in place, the site will be ready for thorough testing and final adjustments before launch. 
Thank you.

Challenges:
The Mobile Navbar development faced some complexities that resulted in an incomplete task. These issues will require additional effort and debugging in the coming week to ensure a smooth and responsive navigation experience across all devices.

Additionally, I encountered network challenges, specifically a lack of reliable data access. This limitation has significantly impacted my ability to reference online resources, access design guidelines, or collaborate in real-time. As a result, I have had to rely heavily on my knowledge, experience, and memory to continue progressing with the frontend development.
Despite the absence of external resources and tools, I have been able to push forward by focusing on key sections of the project and ensuring that the designs meet the required standards. Although this has slowed down the workflow, I have maintained momentum and achieved substantial progress. Once network access is restored, I plan to revisit and fine-tune certain areas to ensure everything aligns perfectly with the original design specifications.
